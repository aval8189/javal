           Although we may have the necessary power in order to create Augmented Reality, we need a portable device that has all the power and easy to built.
           Not only that but have style. Click on Possible Reality to know what I mean, in there are some examples on what I mean. 
           They may be from Anime or films but the idea of a portable device is the key for eveyrthing.
           
           However, Microsoft may have the beginning step with their Holo Lens.

           Both in entertainment and busniess stand point.
